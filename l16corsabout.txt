=>CORS
cross-origin Resource sharing(CORS)

- CORS is a mechanism for integrating applications
- CORS defines are loaded in one domain to interest with different domain 
- CORS allows client browser to check with third-party servers (if request authenticate before data transfer)
- To protect cross-site request forgery (csrf)

Same-Origin policy
URL                                                 Outcome                         Reason
http://dltbank.com/transfer/create.html             Same Origin 
http://dltbank.com/transfer/report/check.html       Same Origin                     Only part different
http://mm.dltbank.com/transfer/report/check.html    Different Origin                Different protocol 
http://eng.dltbank.com.81/transfer/create.html      Different Origin                Different port (http:// is port 80 default)
http://news.dltbank.com.81/transfer/artical.html    Different Origin                Different host

Same-origin policy is highly secure but inflexible for genius use cases.
CORS is an extension of the same-origin policy 
You need CORS when you to pull data from external AIPs that are public or outhorized or (authorize third-party access to your own server resourses)
